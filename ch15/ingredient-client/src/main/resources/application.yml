# Note that the config server URI configured here is different than the one that
# is configured in chapter 14. That's because the one in the book (http://config.tacocloud.com:8888)
# is made up. But when running this locally, you'll want to use http://localhost:8888.
# Also note that http://localhost:8888 is the default, so it is not strictly necessary
# to explicitly set this property in this case.
